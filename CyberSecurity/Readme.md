# 1. Can you explain what cybersecurity is and the CIA triad?

- Sure! Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and digital assets from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption. The goal of cybersecurity is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information.
- The CIA triad is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity that stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These three elements are essential to ensure the security of digital assets:

1. Confidentiality: Refers to the protection of information from unauthorized disclosure. It ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information.

   1.1 Confidentiality: Encryption can be used to protect the confidentiality of information. When sensitive information is encrypted, it becomes unreadable to unauthorized individuals. Only individuals with the appropriate encryption key can decrypt the information and access it.

2. Integrity: Refers to the accuracy and completeness of information. It ensures that information is not modified or tampered with by unauthorized individuals.

   2.1 Integrity: Hashing can be used to ensure the integrity of information. A hash value is generated from the data, and any change in the data will result in a different hash value. By comparing the original hash value with the newly generated hash value, it is possible to detect any unauthorized changes to the data.

3. Availability: Refers to the accessibility of information when it is needed. It ensures that authorized individuals have access to information when they need it.

   3.1 Availability: Encryption can also be used to ensure the availability of information. By encrypting data during transmission, it is protected from unauthorized interception or modification, ensuring that it is available to authorized individuals when they need it.

# 2. Can you explain encryption, decryption, and hashing?

1. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a coded format known as ciphertext, to prevent unauthorized access to the data during transmission or storage. This is achieved by using a mathematical algorithm, which requires a key to encode and decode the data. Encryption ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

2. Decryption, on the other hand, is the process of converting the ciphertext back into plain text by using the same key that was used to encrypt the data. Decryption is used to restore the original data after it has been encrypted. It ensures that only authorized individuals with access to the key can access the data.

3. Hashing is a process of transforming data into a fixed-length string of characters or bytes known as a hash value or hash code. The hash function generates the hash code by using an algorithm that takes the input data and produces a unique fixed-length string. Hashing is a one-way process, which means it cannot be reversed to retrieve the original data. It is used to verify the integrity of the data and to check if the data has been tampered with or not. Hashing is often used to store passwords in a secure way, by storing the hash value of the password instead of the password itself.

# 3. How would you manage and save data from an attacker?

- Managing and saving data from an attacker requires a multi-layered approach that involves both preventative measures and incident response procedures. Here are some general steps that you can take to manage and save data from an attacker:

1. Backup your data regularly: Having a recent backup of your data can help you recover lost or corrupted data in case of an attack.

2. Secure your network: Implement strong access controls, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access to your network.

3. Encrypt sensitive data: Use strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.

4. Monitor your network for suspicious activity: Use tools such as intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block attacks in real-time.

5. Train your employees: Educate your employees on how to identify and respond to security incidents such as phishing attacks, malware infections, and social engineering.

6. Have an incident response plan: Develop and test an incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in case of an attack, including data backup and recovery procedures.

If an attacker does manage to breach your defenses and compromise your data, it's important to preserve the evidence for legal and forensic purposes. Here are some tips for saving data from an attacker:

1. Isolate the affected systems: Disconnect the affected systems from the network to prevent further damage or data loss.

2. Document the incident: Record as much information as possible about the attack, including the time, date, and type of attack, as well as any unusual network activity or system changes.

3. Preserve the data: Make a complete copy of the affected system or devices, including logs, memory, and hard drives. Use write-blocking tools to ensure that the data is not altered during the copying process.

4. Analyze the data: Use forensic analysis tools and techniques to analyze the copied data for evidence of the attack, including the attacker's identity, methods, and motives

# 4. How would you save passwords in a safe manner when working on multiple websites?

1. Use a password manager: A password manager is a secure tool that stores all of your passwords in one encrypted location. It generates strong, unique passwords for each site, so you don't have to remember them all.

2. Use two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. It requires you to enter a code or use a security key in addition to your password, making it much harder for someone to gain access to your accounts.

3. Use strong, unique passwords: If you don't want to use a password manager, make sure you use strong, unique passwords for each site. Avoid using the same password across multiple sites, as this makes it easier for hackers to gain access to multiple accounts.

4. Change your passwords regularly: Regularly changing your passwords can help prevent them from being compromised. It's a good idea to change them every 6-12 months or sooner if you suspect that your account has been hacked.

5. Use HTTPS: Make sure the website you are using has HTTPS enabled. This ensures that your data is encrypted as it travels between your computer and the website's servers.

6. Be cautious of phishing scams: Hackers may try to trick you into revealing your password through phishing scams. Be cautious of emails or messages that ask you to provide your login information or click on a suspicious link.

# 5. Can you explain the advantages of cybersecurity?

1. Protection of sensitive data: Cybersecurity measures protect sensitive data such as personal information, financial records, and business secrets from unauthorized access, theft, or exploitation. This ensures that private information remains confidential and secure.

2. Prevention of financial losses: Cybersecurity measures can prevent financial losses caused by cyber crime such as ransomware attacks, phishing scams, and identity theft. This can save individuals and organizations a lot of money in damages, lost revenue, and legal fees.

3. Maintaining business continuity: Cybersecurity measures ensure that critical systems and data remain operational during cyber attacks, minimizing downtime and preventing disruption to business operations.

4. Protection of reputation: Cybersecurity measures protect an organization's reputation by preventing cyber attacks that could result in a loss of customer trust or a negative public perception of the company.

# 10. What is the Different type of cyber security attack explain ?

- There are several different types of cybersecurity attacks, some of which are described below:

1. Malware attacks: Malware is a type of malicious software that is designed to harm or disrupt computer systems. Malware attacks can include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.

2. Phishing attacks: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that involves tricking users into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. This is often done by sending fraudulent emails or setting up fake websites that appear legitimate.

3. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: DoS attacks are designed to overload a website or network with traffic, causing it to become unavailable to users. This is typically done by flooding the targeted system with traffic from multiple sources.

4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: MitM attacks involve intercepting communication between two parties to steal sensitive information. This can be done by intercepting traffic on an unsecured Wi-Fi network or by compromising a network's security.

5. SQL injection attacks: SQL injection attacks are a type of web-based attack that involves injecting malicious code into a website's database. This can be used to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to a system.

6. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: XSS attacks are a type of web-based attack that involves injecting malicious code into a website to steal sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to a system.

7. Ransomware attacks: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. This type of attack can be devastating for individuals and businesses alike.

# 11. What is malware and how does it affect cybersecurity?

- Malware, short for malicious software, is a type of software that is designed to harm or disrupt computer systems. Malware can come in many forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more.

- Malware can have a significant impact on cybersecurity because it can be used to steal sensitive data, damage computer systems, or disrupt business operations. Some common ways in which malware can affect cybersecurity include:

1. Theft of sensitive information: Malware can be used to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identifiable information (PII).

2. Damage to computer systems: Some types of malware can be used to damage computer systems or corrupt files, which can result in system crashes or data loss.

3. Disruption of business operations: Malware can be used to disrupt business operations, such as by launching a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that overwhelms a website or network with traffic.

4. Installation of additional malware: Some types of malware are designed to install additional malware on a system, which can make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access or steal sensitive data.

- To protect against malware, organizations need to take steps to secure their systems and networks. This can include using antivirus software, applying software patches and updates, and training employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attacks and other types of social engineering. It's also important to have a robust incident response plan in place to respond quickly to any security incidents that do occur.

# 12. What is a brute force attack and how does it impact cybersecurity?

- A brute force attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker tries to gain unauthorized access to a system or network by trying every possible password combination until the correct one is found. Brute force attacks are often used to target systems with weak or easily guessable passwords.

- Brute force attacks can have a significant impact on cybersecurity because they can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or systems. Some common ways in which brute force attacks can impact cybersecurity include:

1. Compromised user accounts: Brute force attacks can be used to compromise user accounts, which can allow attackers to steal sensitive data or use the compromised account to launch additional attacks.

2. Network and system intrusion: Brute force attacks can also be used to gain unauthorized access to networks and computer systems. Once inside, attackers can install additional malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt business operations.

3. Increased risk of data breaches: When attackers gain access to sensitive data through a brute force attack, it can increase the risk of a data breach. This can result in financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liability.

- To protect against brute force attacks, organizations should implement strong password policies, including requiring complex passwords and enforcing password changes at regular intervals. Organizations should also consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires users to provide additional verification beyond a password, such as a fingerprint or security token. Additionally, organizations can use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) tools to detect and respond to brute force attacks in real-time.

<!-- # 13. Can you discuss some recent cyber crimes that have happened? -->

# 14. What is a firewall and how does it help protect against cyber attacks?

- A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks such as the Internet.

- Firewalls work by examining each packet of data that passes through it and checking it against a set of rules. If the packet of data meets the predetermined criteria, it is allowed to pass through the firewall and onto its destination. If it fails to meet the criteria, the firewall blocks it from entering the network.

- Firewalls help protect against cyber attacks by preventing unauthorized access to a network, blocking malicious traffic, and identifying and stopping potential threats. They also help to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access the network and its resources.

- In addition, firewalls can be configured to log network traffic and provide alerts to security personnel when suspicious activity is detected. This allows for quick identification and response to potential threats, minimizing the impact of cyber attacks on the network.

- Overall, firewalls are an essential component of network security and play a critical role in protecting against cyber attacks.

# 16. What are the different types of hackers and what are their motives?

1. White Hat Hackers: Also known as ethical hackers, they work to improve computer security by identifying vulnerabilities in systems and networks before malicious hackers can exploit them. They are usually employed by companies to test their security systems and ensure that they are secure.

2. Black Hat Hackers: Also known as malicious hackers, they break into computer systems or networks with the intention of stealing or damaging information. Their motives are usually financial gain, revenge, or political activism.

3. Grey Hat Hackers: They operate between white hat and black hat hackers, as they do not have malicious intentions, but they may still break into systems without permission. They may do so to test security systems or to expose vulnerabilities to the system owners.

4. Hacktivists: They are politically motivated and use hacking as a form of protest or to raise awareness about a particular cause. They may target government agencies, corporations, or other organizations that they perceive as being unjust.

5. Script Kiddies: They are inexperienced hackers who use pre-written scripts or tools to launch attacks without fully understanding the underlying technology. Their motives are often to gain notoriety or to prove their skills to their peers.

6. State-sponsored Hackers: They are employed by governments to conduct cyber espionage or launch attacks against other nations. Their motives are usually political or economic gain.

# 17. What is the difference between a DoS and a DDoS attack?

- A DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to make a website or network unavailable to its intended users by flooding it with traffic or other forms of disruptive activity. The goal of a DoS attack is to overwhelm the target system's resources, such as its bandwidth, CPU, or memory, and make it unable to respond to legitimate requests.

- A DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack is a more sophisticated form of DoS attack, in which the attacker uses a network of computers (called a botnet) to flood the target system with traffic. The computers in the botnet may be owned by unsuspecting users who have had their systems compromised by malware. This allows the attacker to launch a much larger and more coordinated attack than with a DoS attack.

- The main difference between the two is that a DoS attack is launched from a single source, while a DDoS attack comes from multiple sources, making it much harder to defend against. Additionally, DDoS attacks can generate significantly higher traffic volume and are often used for more complex attacks, such as application layer attacks or targeting specific services, rather than just overwhelming the network.

# 23. What is the default port number of any web application

- The default port number for a web application is usually port 80 for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP Secure). These are the standard port numbers used by web servers to listen for incoming requests from clients.

- HTTP is the protocol used for transmitting web pages and other content over the internet, while HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that encrypts the data being transmitted to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

- However, some web applications may use different port numbers depending on their specific requirements or configurations. For example, a web application that requires secure file transfers may use port 22 (SSH) or 990 (FTP over SSL/TLS) instead of port 443. It's important to check the documentation or configuration of the web application to determine its specific port number(s).

# 24. Difference b/w http and https

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols for transferring data over the internet, but they differ in terms of security.

- HTTP is a protocol used to transfer data between a web server and a web browser. It is a plain text protocol, which means that any data transmitted via HTTP is sent in clear text, which can be intercepted and read by anyone with access to the data stream. This makes HTTP vulnerable to interception, tampering, and eavesdropping.

- On the other hand, HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP. It uses a secure socket layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) protocol to encrypt the data transmitted between the web server and the web browser. This ensures that any data transmitted via HTTPS is secure and protected from interception, tampering, and eavesdropping.

- To summarize, the main difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS provides an additional layer of security through the use of encryption, making it a more secure protocol for transferring data over the internet.

# 25. What do you know about cybersecurity and cyberattacks?

- SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that provide security for data transmitted over the internet. SSL was developed by Netscape in the 1990s, while TLS is its successor, developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

- The SSL and TLS protocols work by encrypting the data transmitted between two endpoints (such as a web server and a web browser), and ensuring its integrity and authenticity. This is achieved through a series of steps known as the "TLS handshake", which involves the following:

1. The client (e.g., a web browser) sends a "ClientHello" message to the server, indicating the protocols and encryption algorithms it supports.

2. The server responds with a "ServerHello" message, selecting the strongest protocol and encryption algorithm both parties support.

3. The server sends its digital certificate to the client, which includes its public key and other identifying information.

4. The client verifies the authenticity of the server's certificate and sends a "ClientKeyExchange" message, which includes a secret key encrypted with the server's public key.

5. The server decrypts the secret key using its private key and sends a "Finished" message to indicate the completion of the handshake.

6. The client responds with its own "Finished" message, and the two parties can now exchange encrypted data using the agreed-upon protocol and encryption algorithm.

   - The current version of TLS is TLS 1.3, which was released in 2018. It includes several improvements over previous versions, such as faster handshake times, improved security, and support for newer encryption algorithms. SSL, on the other hand, is no longer considered secure and has been deprecated in favor of TLS. The last version of SSL, SSL 3.0, was released in 1996 and is vulnerable to several security issues.

# 34. 2 very basic scenario based on CIA triad

- Sure, here are two basic scenario-based examples using the CIA triad:

## 1. Confidentiality Scenario:

- Sarah has some sensitive financial information that she needs to share with her accountant, Bob. Sarah wants to ensure that the information remains confidential and is not accessed by anyone else. To ensure confidentiality, Sarah uses encryption to secure the data in transit and at rest. She also implements access controls to limit access to the information, allowing only Bob to view and work on the data. By implementing these measures, Sarah ensures that the information remains confidential and is only accessible to authorized personnel.

## 2. Integrity Scenario:

- John has a website that he uses to sell his products online. He wants to ensure that the information on his website is accurate and has not been tampered with by malicious actors. To ensure integrity, John uses hashing algorithms to ensure that the data on his website has not been altered or corrupted in any way. He also implements backups to ensure that he can restore the data if it is corrupted or lost. By implementing these measures, John ensures that the information on his website is accurate and has not been tampered with, ensuring the integrity of the data.

<!-- # 35. What is Authentication and Authorization? -->

-

# 36. what is 1 factor 2 factor and 3 factor authentication

- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an individual or entity. There are different levels of authentication, with varying degrees of security.

## 1. One-factor authentication (1FA):

- This is the simplest form of authentication and involves using a single factor to verify the user's identity. The most common example of 1FA is a password. With this method, the user only needs to provide a password or PIN to gain access to their account. However, this method is not very secure, as passwords can be easily compromised or guessed.

## 2. Two-factor authentication (2FA):

- Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires two factors for authentication, which makes it more secure than 1FA. The two factors typically involve something the user knows (such as a password) and something they have (such as a mobile device). This means that even if a hacker manages to guess or steal the user's password, they will still need access to the second factor to gain entry to the user's account.

## 3. Three-factor authentication (3FA):

- Three-factor authentication (3FA) is the most secure method of authentication, and it requires the user to provide three separate factors for authentication. The three factors typically involve something the user knows (such as a password), something they have (such as a mobile device), and something they are (such as a biometric factor like a fingerprint).

# 37. How stock exchange market make them secure from cyber attack

- Stock exchange markets are high-value targets for cyber attackers, as a successful attack can result in significant financial losses and reputational damage. To protect themselves from cyber attacks, stock exchange markets implement a range of security measures, such as:

1. Network segmentation: Stock exchange networks are often segmented into different zones, each with its own security controls and access restrictions. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to move laterally across the network if they gain access to one zone.

2. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems: Stock exchange markets use firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic and detect and block any suspicious activity.

3. Encryption: Encryption is used to protect sensitive data in transit, such as trading data and financial transactions. This is achieved using SSL/TLS protocols and encryption algorithms such as AES.

4. Two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is often used to prevent unauthorized access to trading systems and other critical infrastructure. This typically involves a combination of something the user knows (such as a password) and something they have (such as a security token or biometric identifier).

5. Regular security assessments: Stock exchange markets conduct regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that security controls are effective.

6. Disaster recovery and business continuity planning: Stock exchange markets have comprehensive disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place to ensure that trading can continue even in the event of a cyber attack or other disruption.

7. Staff training and awareness: Stock exchange markets provide regular training and awareness programs to staff to educate them about the latest threats and best practices for cybersecurity.

- Overall, stock exchange markets take a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity, combining technical controls with policies, procedures, and training to protect their critical infrastructure from cyber attacks.

# 38. if i am a cyber security guy and I am responsible to check any website for security so what measures should I check to make this website secure from both frontend and backend

- As a cybersecurity professional, there are a number of measures you should check to ensure that a website is secure from both the frontend and backend. Here are some key areas to focus on:

## Frontend security measures:

1. Secure communication: The website should use HTTPS encryption to ensure that all data transmitted between the client and server is secure and protected from interception.

2. Input validation: The website should validate all user input to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

3. Authentication and authorization: The website should have a robust authentication and authorization mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data or perform privileged actions.

4. Session management: The website should manage user sessions securely to prevent session hijacking or fixation attacks.

5. Content security: The website should use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent malicious scripts from executing on the page and protect against other common web vulnerabilities.

## Backend security measures:

1. Server configuration: The server should be configured securely, with the latest security patches installed and unnecessary services disabled.

2. Access control: The server should have strong access controls in place, with appropriate user permissions and role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms.

3. Database security: The database should be secured with strong passwords, limited user access, and encrypted data storage.

4. Log monitoring: The server logs should be monitored regularly to detect any suspicious activity and investigate potential security incidents.

5. Vulnerability scanning: The server should be scanned regularly for known vulnerabilities using automated tools such as vulnerability scanners.

6. Disaster recovery planning: The server should have a disaster recovery plan in place to ensure that data can be recovered in the event of a security incident or other disruption.

- Overall, ensuring the security of a website requires a holistic approach, with a focus on both frontend and backend security measures. By checking these key areas, you can help ensure that the website is secure and protected from potential cyber threats.
