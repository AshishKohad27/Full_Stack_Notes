## What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?

## What is a horizontal and vertical scaling?

# 1. What is MongoDB, and how does it differ from traditional relational databases?

- MongoDB is a document-oriented database system that stores data as documents in BSON format (a binary representation of JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema, allowing for more flexible and scalable data models.

# 2. How would you compare MongoDB to other NoSQL databases, like Couchbase or Cassandra?

- MongoDB differs from other NoSQL databases in terms of its ease of use, scalability, and performance. For example, MongoDB supports automatic sharding and replication, which makes it easy to scale and distribute data across multiple nodes in a cluster. It also supports rich querying capabilities and a flexible data model.

# 3. Can you explain the difference between a collection and a document in MongoDB?

- In MongoDB, a collection is a group of documents, and a document is a set of key-value pairs. Collections can contain documents with different structures and fields, while documents can have nested structures.

# 4. How do you create a collection or a document in MongoDB?

- To create a collection or a document in MongoDB, you can use the db.createCollection() and db.insertOne() methods, respectively. For example, to create a collection named "users" and insert a new document with the "name" field set to "John", you can run:

```javascript
Copy code
db.createCollection("users")
db.users.insertOne({ name: "John" })
```

# 5. How does MongoDB handle concurrency and consistency in a distributed system?

- MongoDB uses a distributed consensus protocol called "replica sets" to provide high availability and consistency. Each replica set consists of multiple nodes, where one node is elected as the primary and the others are secondary nodes. When a primary node fails, the other nodes automatically elect a new primary. MongoDB also supports distributed locking to ensure consistency in concurrent write operations.

# 6. Can you explain the difference between sharding and replication in MongoDB?

- Sharding is the process of partitioning data across multiple nodes in a cluster, while replication is the process of creating copies of data on multiple nodes for high availability. In MongoDB, sharding and replication can be combined to create a highly scalable and fault-tolerant database system.

# 7. How do you ensure data security and authentication in MongoDB?

- MongoDB provides several security features, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption. Authentication can be enabled using username/password or X.509 certificates. Authorization can be managed using roles and privileges. Encryption can be enabled for data at rest and in transit using SSL/TLS.

# 8. How do you optimize MongoDB performance and improve query efficiency?

- To optimize MongoDB performance and query efficiency, you can use techniques such as indexing, projection, and aggregation. Indexing can speed up query execution by creating indexes on frequently queried fields. Projection can reduce the amount of data returned by a query by selecting only the required fields. Aggregation can perform complex data processing tasks using pipeline stages such as filtering, grouping, and sorting.

# 9. Can you give an example of how you would use MongoDB's aggregation framework?

- The MongoDB aggregation framework is a pipeline-based framework for performing data aggregation operations. It consists of a series of pipeline stages that process input documents and produce output documents. Some common pipeline stages include $match, $group, $sort, $project, and $lookup.

# 10. How do you backup and restore data in MongoDB?

- To backup and restore data in MongoDB, you can use the mongodump and mongorestore utilities, respectively. mongodump creates a binary dump of the data in a MongoDB instance, while mongorestore restores the data from a binary dump file. You can also use MongoDB's built-in backup and restore mechanisms, such as cloud backup services and MongoDB Ops Manager.

# Aggregation

## 1. What is the MongoDB aggregation framework, and how does it differ from other querying mechanisms in MongoDB?

- The MongoDB aggregation framework is a pipeline-based framework for performing data aggregation operations. It differs from other querying mechanisms in MongoDB, such as the find() method, by allowing for complex data processing tasks such as filtering, grouping, and sorting using a series of pipeline stages. The aggregation framework is often used for reporting and data analysis purposes.

## 2. How do you use the $match stage in the aggregation pipeline, and what is its purpose?

- The $match stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to filter input documents based on a specified condition. It is similar to the find() method in MongoDB, but it operates on the input documents in the aggregation pipeline. For example, to find all documents in a collection where the status field is set to "active", you can use the following pipeline:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([{ $match: { status: "active" } }]);
```

## 3. What is the $group stage in the aggregation pipeline, and how do you use it to group data?

- The $group stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to group input documents by a specified field or expression and perform aggregation functions such as counting, summing, or averaging. For example, to group documents in a collection by the status field and count the number of documents in each group, you can use the following pipeline:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([{ $group: { _id: "$status", count: { $sum: 1 } } }]);
```

## 4. How do you use the $project stage in the aggregation pipeline, and what is its purpose?

- The $project stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to reshape input documents by selecting or excluding fields, adding new fields, or transforming existing fields. For example, to project only the name and age fields from documents in a collection, you can use the following pipeline:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([{ $project: { name: 1, age: 1 } }]);
```

## 5. What is the $sort stage in the aggregation pipeline, and how do you use it to sort data?

- The $sort stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to sort input documents by one or more fields in ascending or descending order. For example, to sort documents in a collection by the age field in descending order, you can use the following pipeline:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([{ $sort: { age: -1 } }]);
```

## 6. How do you use the $lookup stage in the aggregation pipeline, and what is its purpose?

- The $lookup stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to perform a left outer join between two collections and return matching documents from both collections. For example, to join documents in a collection named orders with documents in a collection named products based on the product_id field, you can use the following pipeline:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",
      localField: "product_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "product",
    },
  },
]);
```

## 7. What is the $unwind stage in the aggregation pipeline, and how do you use it to transform data?

Sure, here's another example of how to use the $unwind stage in the aggregation pipeline:

Suppose we have a collection of documents that contain an array of "sales" objects, each of which represents a sale of a particular product. Here's an example document:

```javascript
{
"\_id": ObjectId("61f3d1c1d2b36f7819250ef7"),
"customer_id": "C001",
"sales": [
{ "product_id": "P001", "quantity": 2, "price": 10.99 },
{ "product_id": "P002", "quantity": 1, "price": 5.99 }
]
}
```

We can use the $unwind stage to transform the "sales" array into individual documents, like this:

```javascript
db.customers.aggregate([{ $unwind: "$sales" }]);
```

After applying the $unwind stage, the above document will be transformed into two documents, one for each "sales" object in the array:

```javascript
{
"\_id": ObjectId("61f3d1c1d2b36f7819250ef7"),
"customer_id": "C001",
"sales": { "product_id": "P001", "quantity": 2, "price": 10.99 }
},
{
"\_id": ObjectId("61f3d1c1d2b36f7819250ef7"),
"customer_id": "C001",
"sales": { "product_id": "P002", "quantity": 1, "price": 5.99 }
}
```

Now we can use other aggregation pipeline stages to operate on the individual sales objects as separate documents. For example, we could use the $group stage to calculate the total revenue generated by each product:

```javascript
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$sales" },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$sales.product_id",
      revenue: { $sum: { $multiply: ["$sales.quantity", "$sales.price"] } },
    },
  },
]);
```

This would return a result like this:

```javascript

{ "_id" : "P001", "revenue" : 21.98 }
{ "_id" : "P002", "revenue" : 5.99 }

```

## 8. How do you use the $out stage in the aggregation pipeline, and what is its purpose?

Suppose we have a collection called orders, with the following documents:

```json
{
"\_id": ObjectId("60b68fb48e4029427c5a5b5f"),
"customer_id": "1234",
"date": ISODate("2023-01-15T00:00:00Z"),
"items": [
{ "name": "Item A", "price": 10 },
{ "name": "Item B", "price": 20 },
{ "name": "Item C", "price": 30 }
]
},
{
"\_id": ObjectId("60b68fb48e4029427c5a5b60"),
"customer_id": "5678",
"date": ISODate("2023-01-25T00:00:00Z"),
"items": [
{ "name": "Item B", "price": 20 },
{ "name": "Item D", "price": 40 }
]
}
```

We can use the following aggregation pipeline to calculate the total revenue generated by each customer in the month of January and store the results in a new collection called january_revenue:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      date: { $gte: ISODate("2023-01-01"), $lt: ISODate("2023-02-01") },
    },
  },
  { $unwind: "$items" },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$customer_id",
      total_revenue: {
        $sum: { $multiply: ["$items.price", "$items.quantity"] },
      },
    },
  },
  { $out: "january_revenue" },
]);
```

- This pipeline does the following:

1. Filters for documents with a date field that falls within the month of January.
2. Unwinds the items array so that each item becomes a separate document.
3. Groups the documents by customer_id and calculates the total revenue for each customer by multiplying the price of each item by its quantity and summing the results.
4. Writes the results to a new collection called january_revenue.
