## **FIND DUPLICATE IN AN ARRAY**

Given an array A of N elements that contains elements from 1 to N-1. All elements occur once except one which occurs twice. Find the repeating element.

#### **Sample Input**

    N = 5, A = [1, 3, 3, 2, 4]

#### **Sample Output**

    Output: 3

#### **Sample Explanation**

Element 3 appears twice in the array. Hence it is the only repeating element.

## **Expected Time Complexity**

**O**(N), where N is the size of the array

## **Expected Space Complexity**

**O**(1), i.e., constant space complexity.

## **Constraints**

    1 <= N <= 100000
