# Super() :- called the constructor of super class

- By defualt every method as super in it

```java
class A extends Object // every class in java extends in Object even though we don't mension it -> Object -> is class in java erevy class in java extend in object class
// class A // same every class in java extends in Object even though we don't mension it
{
    public A()
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write // this super called constructor of Object
        System.out.println("in A");
    }
    public A(int n)
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write
        System.out.println("in A int: ");
    }
}

class B extends A
{
    public B()
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write
        System.out.println("in B");
    }

    public B(int n)
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write
        System.out.println("in B int: ");
    }
}

class C extends A
{
    public C()
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write
        System.out.println("in C");
    }

    public C(int n)
    {
        super(n); // we have int in super so now int A() method called
        System.out.println("in C int: ");
    }
}

class D extends A
{
    public D()
    {
        super(5); // adding int so now int A() method called
        System.out.println("in D");
    }

    public D(int n)
    {
        super(n); // we have int in super so now int A() method called
        System.out.println("in D int: ");
    }
}

class Hello {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
       B obj_B1 = new B();
       System.out.println(" ");

       B obj_B = new B(7);
       System.out.println(" ");

       C obj_C = new C(7);
       System.out.println(" ");

       D obj_D = new D();

       // Step 1: goes to B class B(7) method and when we have int in it its goes to that int B() method
       // Step 2: super(); --> called the constructor of super class in our case it is A class
       // step 3: then super class constructor defaults method run A()
       // step 4: first print "in A"
       // step 5: then print "in B int"

       // if we pass n in super in C() method then int A() method will called
    }
}
```

# this()

```java
class A extends Object // every class in java extends in Object even though we don't mension it
// class A // same every class in java extends in Object even though we don't mension it
{
    public A()
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write // this super called constructor of Object
        System.out.println("in A");
    }
    public A(int n)
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write
        System.out.println("in A int: ");
    }
}

class B extends A
{
    public B()
    {
        super(); // by default even though we don't write
        System.out.println("in B");
    }

    public B(int n)
    {
        this(); // this will execute construtor of same class
        System.out.println("in B int: ");
    }
}

class Hello {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
       B obj_B = new B(7);
       System.out.println(" ");


       // Step 1: goes to B class B(7) method and when we have int in it its goes to that int B() method
       // Step 2: this(); --> called the constructor of same class in our case it is B class
       // step 3: then B class B() method called
       // step 4: then super() default will called super class A in that A() method called

       /*
        * in A
        * in B
        * in B int:
        */
    }
}
