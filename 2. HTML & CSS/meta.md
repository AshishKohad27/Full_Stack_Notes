1. Title Tag: This is one of the most important meta tags. It defines the title of your web page and appears as the title in search engine results and browser tabs.

```htm
<title>Your Page Title</title>
```

2. Description Tag: This meta tag provides a brief description of your web page's content. It's often displayed in search engine results and social media shares.

```htm
<meta name="description" content="A concise description of your page content" />
```

3. Keywords Tag (less important nowadays): This tag used to be important for search engines, but it's less influential now. It specifies keywords relevant to your page's content.

```htm
<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" />
```

4. Viewport Tag: This tag is important for responsive design. It sets the viewport width and initial scale of the webpage for mobile devices.

```htm
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

5. Charset Tag: Specifies the character encoding for your webpage.

```htm
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

6. Author Tag: Indicates the author of the web page.

```htm
<meta name="author" content="Author Name" />
```

7. Robots Tag: Instructs search engine robots on how to index or follow your page. Common values are "index" (allow indexing) and "nofollow" (don't follow links on the page).

```htm
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
```

8. Canonical Tag: Helps avoid duplicate content issues by specifying the preferred version of a page if multiple URLs point to similar content.

```htm
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/preferred-page" />
```

9. Open Graph (OG) Tags: Used by social media platforms to display content when a webpage is shared. They provide information like title, description, image, etc.

```htm
<meta property="og:title" content="Title for Sharing" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Description for Sharing" />
<meta property="og:image" content="URL to an image" />
<meta property="og:url" content="URL of the page" />
```

10. Twitter Card Tags: Similar to Open Graph tags, these are specifically for Twitter sharing.

```htm
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Title for Twitter" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Description for Twitter" />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="URL to an image" />
```

Remember, while meta tags can provide useful information, they won't guarantee high search engine rankings. High-quality content and other SEO techniques are also crucial for improving your webpage's visibility and user engagement.
