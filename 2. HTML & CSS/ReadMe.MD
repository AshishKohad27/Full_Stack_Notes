# 1. What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?

- In HTML and CSS, elements are classified into two main categories: block-level elements and inline-level elements.

Block-level elements are those which generate a block-level box, meaning that they take up the full width of their parent container and stack on top of each other, creating a new line for each subsequent element. Examples of block-level elements include headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.), paragraphs (p), divs, lists (ul, ol), and form elements.

On the other hand, inline-level elements generate an inline-level box, meaning that they occupy only the necessary width to display their content, and do not cause a line break. Inline-level elements include text elements such as span, a, strong, em, and image elements (img).

It's also worth noting that some elements can behave as both block-level and inline-level elements depending on how they are used. For example, the <a> tag is an inline-level element by default, but can be turned into a block-level element by applying a display property of "block" or "inline-block". Similarly, the <div> tag is a block-level element by default, but can be turned into an inline-level element by applying a display property of "inline" or "inline-block".
